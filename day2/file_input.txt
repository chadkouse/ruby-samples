This is your first chance to see some of Ruby’s
sugar and also a little of the magic. You’re
starting to see how flexible Ruby can be. The 
collections are dead simple: two collections with multiple APIs 
layered on top. Application performance is secondary. Ruby 
is about the performance of the programmer. The enumerable 
module gives you a flavor of just how well-
designed Ruby can be. The single-inheritance object-
oriented structure certainly isn’t novel, but the 
implementation is packed with intuitive design and useful features. 
This level of abstraction gives you a marginally better programming 
language, but serious mojo is on the way.
